The latest real estate numbers are in from the month of September so I wanted to bring them to you as we start October.&nbsp;

Some of these numbers are absolutely insane. **For example, we had 526 residential sales in September, which is up 17.7% from last year.** At the same time, residential listings were down by 2.1%.

For detached homes, we had 330 homes sales last month. That’s up by 20.4%. The number of condo sales, however, were down by 24%. **Townhome sales were up by 34.4% and semi-detached sales were up by 10%.**

**Overall, the average sale price is actually yup 10.2% from this time last year and now sits at $541,850.** The average prices for detached homes, townhomes, and semi-detached homes all increased by double digits, while the price for condos increased by just 3%.

If you have any questions for me about any of these numbers or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
