We hope you’re doing well and keeping safe. We want you to know that if If there is anything we can do to help, please just let us know. Real estate related or not, our team is here for you.

Instead of discussing the COVID- 19 that’s currently upon us, we thought we would check in to see what our friends have been up to; see what you’re doing with your newfound wealth of time? We would like to believe there is a silver lining to everything and maybe, this is natures way of reminding us to take the time to enjoy the things we love. Perhaps spend some more time focusing on the things we care about. Our team has been fortunate enough to spend some extra time with our families while still being able to help our clients reach their goals; because here at VLA, that’s something we care about.

We’ve put together a plan so we can better serve our clients through these unusual circumstances while still respecting guidelines to help flatten the curve.

We would like to also say a gigantic Thank you to everyone working the front line for their efforts.&nbsp; From Nurses & Doctors, to grocery store clerks and truck drivers, we see the sacrifices being made to help keep this country running; Time away from your family, longer hours, some can’t even go inside of their own homes without putting their families at risk. So we need to tell you, Thank you for your service. We appreciate you.

Again, real estate related or not, if there is anything, we can help you with in this unfamiliar time, please reach out to us. We are here to help support our community always.

Stay safe friends.
