We hope you’re doing well and keeping safe. We ask that if there is anything we can do to help you or your loves ones, please just let us know. Real estate-related or not, our team is always here for you.

Instead of focusing on the unfortunate COVID-19 pandemic that’s currently upon us, we thought we would check in to see what our friends have been up to and see what you’re doing with your newfound wealth of time. We would like to believe there is a silver lining to everything, and maybe this is nature's way of reminding us to take the time to enjoy the things we love. Perhaps spend some more time focusing on the things we care about. Our team has been fortunate enough to spend some extra time with our families while still being able to help our clients reach their goals, because here at VLA, that’s something we care about.

So, we’ve taken some time toput together a plan so that we may better serve our clients through these unusual circumstances while still respecting guidelines and doing our part to flatten the curve. Check out our video to hear more.

We would like to also say a huge thank you to everyone working on the front lines for their efforts. From nurses and doctors to grocery store clerks and truck drivers, we see the sacrifices being made to help keep this country running. Time away from their families, longer work hours; some can’t even go inside of their own homes without putting their families at risk. So, from the bottom of our hearts we need to say thank you for your services.

Again, real estate-related or not, please let us know if there’s a way we can help you and your families get through these strange times. We are here to help support our community always.

Stay safe, friends.
