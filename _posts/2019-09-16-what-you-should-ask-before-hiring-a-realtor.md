9,716 homes have been listed in our market so far, but only 6,116 of those listings actually sold. This means 33% of all homes in our local market have failed to sell. Why has this happened?&nbsp;

My guess is that, in many instances, those homes failed to sell because they were being represented by the wrong agent. This just goes to show how important your choice of Realtor really is when the time comes for you to sell, and the key to choosing the right agent is to ask the right questions before you hire them. Here are a few questions you should pose to any agent you’re thinking of working with:&nbsp;

**1\. “How many months of inventory are available in my area compared to the overall region?”** Questions like this will not only help you to understand market conditions, but will also help you gauge how knowledgeable an agent is. In addition to explaining local inventory by area, the agent should also be able to break down inventory levels by price point

**2\. “What kind of marketing strategy will you use for my home?”** The way your agent presents your property to the market could make or break your success. If they’re planning to solely rely on antiquated methods like newspaper ads, for example, you may want to work with someone else. It isn’t that newspaper advertising is bad; it’s just that the right agent should use multiple channels, including modern ones like social media, to maximize your home’s exposure.

**3\. “What training events have you attended to continue your education as an agent?”** In real estate, continued education is key. Simply having a real estate license isn’t enough. The right agent for you and your home sale is one who stays current with the latest best practices.

**4\. “How much time will you spend prospecting?”** Putting your home on the multiple listing service and hoping buyers take notice isn’t enough. The agent you hire should be one who is proactive in seeking out interested buyers for your property.&nbsp;

**5\. “What makes you stand out from other agents?”** It goes without saying that a truly outstanding agent will have some unique qualities that set them apart from the common Realtor, and knowing what these qualities are, specifically, could guide you to making the right decision for your home sale.&nbsp;
