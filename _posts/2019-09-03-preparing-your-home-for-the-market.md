If you’re gearing up to list your home soon, there are a few tips to keep in mind if you want to sell quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;

First, **declutter the home.** This means clearing off your countertops and making sure you have clean surfaces throughout the home. If buyers see clutter lying around, it will distract them from making an emotional connection to your home.&nbsp;

Along with decluttering, you need to depersonalize the home. Remember, you want buyers to visualize themselves living in your home—not seeing who lives there now. Take down any family photos and try replacing them with some artwork or more generic photos.&nbsp;

Next, **have a contractor or handyman visit your home and give it a good once-over.** You never know—there may be spots that need to be repainted or trim that needs repair. Buyers notice little items like these, and taking care of them will help your home stand out among the competition.&nbsp;

Also, consider getting a pre-inspection for your home. I’ve had several clients get higher offers with fewer conditions specifically because buyers knew their home had a pre-inspection. The home inspector will make sure your home’s not hiding any potential deal-killers that will cause the deal to fall apart after the buyer has already gone under contract. A pre-inspection also gives you the chance to fix any issues beforehand, which saves you money in the long run because you won’t have to worry about taking money off the sale price if the buyer discovers any issues.&nbsp;

After that, it’s time to **hire a professional stager to stage the home.** We include a staging consultation in our services, and stagers will be able to advise you on furniture placement, wall decor, paint colors, decluttering and depersonalization, etc. They’ll have your home in the best shape possible when the time comes to take listing photos and videos.&nbsp;
