Here are four quick tips to remember if you plan on listing your home during the holiday season:

**1\. Decorate the house.** With the holiday season in full swing, your home is likely already in good condition, but don’t go overboard with your decorations. Stick to a classier look.&nbsp;

**2\. Hire the right agent.** Make sure your agent communicates with you directly throughout the holidays and doesn’t just disappear when you need them. You can also coordinate your schedules so you don’t have to show your home during important times.&nbsp;

**3\. Give buyers a place to escape the cold.** If it’s snowing out, have the heat turned up, play some soft music in the background, and set the tone once they walk into your home.&nbsp;

**4\. Have a great video tour and marketing campaign for your home.** There might be fewer buyers out there right now, but good social media marketing will capture their attention, and they’ll be able to see a 360-degree tour of your home before they see it in person.&nbsp;

If you have questions about selling during the holidays or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
