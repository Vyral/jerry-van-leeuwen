We’re nearing the end of summer, so it’s time to take a quick look at how our 2019 summer market is doing as we wrap things up.&nbsp;

This year, **we’ve seen a high level of demand for homes priced at $600,000 or less**—a sign that we’re still feeling the effects of the “stress test” we faced in 2018. Right now, we have about two to three months’ worth of inventory below the $500,000 range, and we see that number rise to between five and six months of inventory in the $500,000-to-$700,000 range. And with homes priced higher than $700,000, inventory shoots up to about eight months’ worth. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Keep in mind that **the Bank of Canada did just lower the qualifying rate to 5.19%,** which helped to kickstart more activity among first-timers and in some of the lower price points. In a nutshell, lower-priced homes are still selling strong. &nbsp;&nbsp;

**Why is this important information for both buyers and sellers?&nbsp;**

Starting with buyers, it’s important to understand what you can expect given current market conditions. For instance, if you’re a first-time buyer and you’re entering the market for a $400,000 to $500,000 home, odds are that we’ll see some pretty stiff competition and multiple offers above asking price.&nbsp;

The good news is **that we’ll likely find homes that have spent a longer-than-normal amount of time on the market, which will allow us to negotiate for favorable terms.** If we find ourselves in a multiple-offer situation, we can employ certain tactics to give ourselves an edge over the competition (e.g., a personal letter to the seller, preemptive inspections, etc.).&nbsp;

On the seller side, if you’re pricing your home between $300,000 and $600,000, we’ll see a flurry of buyer activity. But because buyers are being a bit picky right now, **it’s paramount that we still price at market value.&nbsp;**

On our team, we offer different strategies for pricing your home to bring as many buyers as possible to your door and potentially initiate a multiple-offer situation. No matter your goals, we’re here to help.&nbsp;
