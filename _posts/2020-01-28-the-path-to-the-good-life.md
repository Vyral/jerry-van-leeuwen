On March 19, Sai Lee of The Mortgage Guys and I are hosting The Path to the Good Life, and you’re invited\!

**This event will answer three important financial questions that keep people up at night:**

1. How do you pay off your mortgage in 10 years—or in half the time of a regular 25- or 30-year mortgage?
2. How do you pay off your children’s education in full?&nbsp;
3. How do you build extra wealth for retirement on top of everything else you’re doing?

Sai will use numbers from real-life examples addressing each of these questions. He’ll also cover different types of investment; he’ll tell you what those investments are, and why some are better than others. For example, we’ll delve into the strategy of putting your money into buying a business, the share market, and real estate investments.&nbsp;

This event is intended for anyone who’s curious about getting into the market, whether you’re a first-time homebuyer or your average household investor. These are concepts anyone can learn.&nbsp;

**To RSVP, give us a call or email us at [vanleeuwenadvisors@gmail.com](mailto:vanleeuwenadvisors@gmail.com).** We will also be sending out invites VIA Eventbrite so make sure to keep an eye out for it\! We hope to see you there\!
