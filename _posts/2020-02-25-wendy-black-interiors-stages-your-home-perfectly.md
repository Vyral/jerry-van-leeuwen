I recently met with Wendy Black of Wendy Black Interiors, a preferred vendor of Van Leeuwen Real Estate Advisors.&nbsp;

Her business, which she started 12 years ago, focuses primarily on home staging and staging consultations. If you’re a home seller in need of a dinette set or certain pieces to compliment your originals, Wendy and her team can add to it or do a full-furnishing if you have a vacant house.&nbsp;

**Wendy’s work is absolutely and consistently amazing\!&nbsp;**

At her warehouse (check out a tour at 0:51), Wendy has an extensive array of artwork—everything from large to small, abstracts to florals. During a consultation, Wendy assesses a seller’s decor and cross-references it with her vast inventory to find perfect matches. Her pieces are so tasteful that oftentimes sellers arrange to buy something similar for their new homes.&nbsp;

According to Wendy, the newest trend in interior decor is a general move away from glass and chrome, though they’re still useful in particular situations. On the other hand, warm woods are very popular right now.&nbsp;

How does she manage her massive collection, constantly setting up pieces in homes and taking them down soon after it sells? Wendy credits her exceptional, speedy staff, some of which have worked for her for the past five years; **they can set up an entire house in a couple of hours.&nbsp;**

Wendy Black Interiors gives sellers an edge by setting an attractive, radiant, and comfortable atmosphere within their home. If you’re a seller wanting to get in touch with Wendy and her team, **[visit her website](https://www.wendyblackinteriors.com/){: target="_blank"}** and browse their portfolio; further contact information is listed there as well.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any real estate questions for me, please feel free to reach out by phone or email. I love hearing from you and helping in whatever way I can.
