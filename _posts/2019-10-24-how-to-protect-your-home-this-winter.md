Fall is here and winter is coming. With that being said, here are a few tips to help you prepare your home to have a calm winter and a more pleasant spring:

**1\. Check your HVAC and have it serviced.** Replace your filter, too\! If you have an older thermostat, it might be time to consider switching to a programmable thermostat to save you a few bucks.

**2\. Inspect your windows and doors.** If there are cracks or air leaks, recaulk before winter to save even further on those heating costs.

**3\. Clean out your gutters.** Gutters that are clogged lead to water build-up and ice damming. This is definitely something you don’t want in the middle of winter.

**4\. Reverse your ceiling fans.** By reversing your fans, it will push the warm air from your furnace down to keep your living spaces warmer.&nbsp;

**5\. Turn off your exterior water taps.** I’ve learned this the hard way. Hearing something burst in the wall during a cold night could lead to an explosion like it did for me.

If you have any questions for me or if you’re thinking about buying or selling a home anytime soon, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
