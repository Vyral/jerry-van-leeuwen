Hello Readers,&nbsp;

Welcome back\! Our first Long weekend of the year approaches and for many of us, it will feel a bit different this year. Maybe you should be gathering at the cottage with some friends or travelling to go see some loved ones, and although these options aren't possible just yetâ€¦ there seems to be some good news on the horizon\! &nbsp;

### Gradual 3 Stage Plan

There has been a lot of talk lately about the government starting its new 3 stage plan to begin reopening the economy. Here's what we can expect to to come in the next few weeks.

##### Stage 1&nbsp;

* Opening select workplaces where people can meet current health guidelines
* Allowing essential gatherings of a limited number of people&nbsp;
* opening some outdoor spaces
* Continuing the protection guidelines of some vulnerable populations

##### Stage 2

* Opening more workplaces with significant mitigation plans
* Opening more outdoor spaces and allowing more larger public gatherings
* Still continue with protection guidelines of vulnerable populations

##### Stage 3&nbsp;

* opening all workplaces responsibly
* relaxing the restrictions on public gatherings.&nbsp;

Being able to move our communities to the next stage, is however based on a few following conditions. ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

* A consistent 2-4 week decrease in the number of new daily covid cases&nbsp;
* Approx 90 % of new covid contacts are being reached by local public health officials within one day&nbsp;
* ongoing testing of suspected covid cases in order to detect new cases quickly.&nbsp;

The Ontario government also announced on Wednesday, they have now launched a new program called Regional relief and Recovery Program ( RRRF) for businesses this week that perhaps didn't qualify for previous employment programs. Visit&nbsp;[www.canada.ca/news](https://www.canada.ca/en/news.html) for more information.&nbsp;

###### Here are some recent and upcoming re-openings for this week.&nbsp;

Our favorite amusement park would normally be opening for the season this month but no date has been set for reopening just yet, they did release a statement last week sharing that construction on their new attractions, is set to resume shortly and should be completed in a months time. In the meantime, you can ride an online roller coaster or try your luck at making their famous funnel cake at home\! Visit www.canadaswonderland.com for all kinds of fun and activities.&nbsp;

Our beloved Toronto Raptors lead the way for easing restrictions on pro sports teams last week by allowing them to open their training facilities while following strict " established and safety protocols". The NBA has been suspended since March 11 along with other pro-sport leagues. We bet it feels good for them to get back to it\!&nbsp;

Provincial Parks and conservation areas in Ontario are set to reopen by the end of this week for limited day day use access. This means its time to hit your favorite trails for some hiking, biking and long walks with the fam. &nbsp;Camping, beaches and other activities are still prohibited for now, but this is definitely a plus in our books\!&nbsp;

We wish all of our readers a happy and safe first long weekend of 2020. May the days be sunny and laughs be plenty\!&nbsp;
