## Financial

* Starting just this past Monday, April 27, Employers have been able to successfully apply for the Canada Wage Subsidy Benefit provided to help employers prevent unnecessary lay offs due to the effects of Covid-19.&nbsp;
* The Ontario Government has also introduced a Pandemic Pay program for eligible frontline workers.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

The program will provide a $4 increase per hour worked on top of existing hourly wage. In addition, workers who reach over 100 hours per month will be receiving a $250 lump sum payment for the next four months. The program did not initially include all frontline workers but has since been expanded to include a number of of groups, such as paramedics and all mental health workers.&nbsp;![](/uploads/e-wokrers.PNG){: width="739" height="196"}
