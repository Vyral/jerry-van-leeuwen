Hello Readers,&nbsp;

Welcome back\! We hope you all enjoyed your long weekends, despite the two days of rain\! On the bright side, it did give some time to get both outdoor and indoor projects completed. Lots of exciting things happening lately...&nbsp;

Just Kidding\!\!\! But it is definitely out for the summer\! Premier Ford, announced on Tuesday that the province has cancelled in person learning for the remainder of this school year. the online learning however, will still continue and students will still receive report cards. Students that were on track to graduate as of March, will still be able too based on their report cards.&nbsp;

This includes all private schools and licensed child card centers. However, the gradual reopening of child care is expected to begin when the Province begins Phase 2 of the economic plan. Education minister, Stephen Leece said there is a full plan to reopen schools for the Sept school year that will be released by the end of June and that summer learning opportunities are being provided.&nbsp;

###### So what kind of summer learning programs can we expect to see?

The dept of education has released a document that thoroughly explains the continuation of the online learning program but its seems to include seven main areas of focus:

We've provided the link to the full document provided by the Ontario government outlining the plan just below.&nbsp;

Well we've got good news and bad news.. Overnight summer camps have all been cancelled however, if public health indicators "allow", then both indoor and outdoor summer camps will still happen in July and August\! There will be very strict health guidelines attached to this so we will keep an ear out and hopefully hear something soon\!&nbsp;

With Phase 1 in the beginning stages and warm weather starting to come, communities may tend to feel like Covid 19 has just disappeared, but that is certainly not the case.&nbsp; Last week Premier Doug Ford said, " *The people of Ontario have been doing a fantastic job to help flatten the curve and stop the spread of this terrible virus."*&nbsp;

The good news is that several outdoor spots are beginning to open up\!&nbsp; Outdoor picnic sites, off leash dog parks, and shelters in parks and rec areas are among the first\! Our door playgrounds, structures, pool and splash pads still remain closed at this time.&nbsp;

##### The 401 is in its final stages of expansion\!&nbsp;

Premier Doug Ford announced this week that the final stages of construction on the 40-1 spot between Hespeler Road and Townline Road is set to begin\! Phase 2 includes widening the highways from the current 6 to 10 lanes. The expected construction is estimated to take just over two years, taking us into 2023 by the time its finished. Although the timeline doesn't sound ideal, its certainly sounds like congestion an traffic flow will definitely be improved.&nbsp;
