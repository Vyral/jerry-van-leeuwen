Mother's Day is just around the corner and the kids sadly won't be bringing home school made gifts this year\! And let's be honestâ€¦ Moms have been working overtime the past few weeks so it's a perfect time to show them how much we&nbsp; appreciate everything they do for us. We've got a few ideas for youâ€¦

##### 1\. Bring Brunch to her\!&nbsp;

Brunch is an all time FAV on Mothers Day so why stop the tradition now? Local hot spots like Bingemans, The Cambridge Mill & The Old Marina Restaurant are now offering pre-order brunch menus you can pick up and bring home for MOM\! Check out their websites to see the menus\! &nbsp;

We know at the need of the day, sometimes all that's needed is a simple Thank you to show appreciation. Our team here at VLA wanted to show our appreciation for all the hardworking moms out there, we've put together the \#ThankyouMom Giveaway\!&nbsp;
