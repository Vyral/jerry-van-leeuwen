        "content": "I recently met with Wendy Black of Wendy Black Interiors, a preferred vendor of Van Leeuwen Real Estate Advisors. Her business, which she started 12 years ago, focuses primarily on home staging and staging consultations. If you’re a home seller in need of a dinette set or certain pieces to compliment your originals, Wendy and her team can add to it or do a full-furnishing if you have a vacant house. Wendy’s work is absolutely and consistently amazing! At her warehouse (check out a tour at 0:51), Wendy has an extensive array of artwork—everything from large to small, abstracts to florals. During a consultation, Wendy assesses a seller’s decor and cross-references it with her vast inventory to find perfect matches. Her pieces are so tasteful that oftentimes sellers arrange to buy something similar for their new homes. “Wendy Black Interiors gives sellers an edge by setting an attractive, radiant, and comfortable atmosphere within their home.”According to Wendy, the newest trend in interior decor is a general move away from glass and chrome, though they’re still useful in particular situations. On the other hand, warm woods are very popular right now. How does she manage her massive collection, constantly setting up pieces in homes and taking them down soon after it sells? Wendy credits her exceptional, speedy staff, some of which have worked for her for the past five years; they can set up an entire house in a couple of hours. Wendy Black Interiors gives sellers an edge by setting an attractive, radiant, and comfortable atmosphere within their home. If you’re a seller wanting to get in touch with Wendy and her team, visit her website and browse their portfolio; further contact information is listed there as well. As always, if you have any real estate questions for me, please feel free to reach out by phone or email. I love hearing from you and helping in whatever way I can.",

How do you pay off your children’s education in full?   How do you build extra wealth for retirement on top of everything else you’re doing?“This event is intended for anyone who’s curious about getting into the market.”Sai will use numbers from real-life examples addressing each of these questions. He’ll also cover different types of investment; he’ll tell you what those investments are, and why some are better than others. For example, we’ll delve into the strategy of putting your money into buying a business, the share market, and real estate investments. This event is intended for anyone who’s curious about getting into the market, whether you’re a first-time homebuyer or your average household investor. These are concepts anyone can learn. To RSVP, give us a call or email us at vanleeuwenadvisors@gmail.com. We will also be sending out invites VIA Eventbrite so make sure to keep an eye out for it!

With the holiday season in full swing, your home is likely already in good condition, but don’t go overboard with your decorations. Stick to a classier look. 2. Hire the right agent. Make sure your agent communicates with you directly throughout the holidays and doesn’t just disappear when you need them. You can also coordinate your schedules so you don’t have to show your home during important times. “Make sure your agent communicates with you directly throughout the holidays.”3. Give buyers a place to escape the cold. If it’s snowing out, have the heat turned up, play some soft music in the background, and set the tone once they walk into your home. 4. Have a great video tour and marketing campaign for your home. There might be fewer buyers out there right now, but good social media marketing will capture their attention, and they’ll be able to see a 360-degree tour of your home before they see it in person. If you have questions about selling during the holidays or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.",

What sorts of repairs most often come up on an inspection report?  The roof—What is the age, condition, and life expectancy?  Heating and air conditioning—Does it function properly? When was it last serviced?  Structural integrity—Did the previous owners do any renovations? Were those done to code?  Foundation—Are there any cracks in the foundation that could potentially allow water to seep in?  Windows—What are their ages, conditions, and life expectancies?  Walls—Some inspectors will use an infrared camera to look through the walls to see if there are any cold spots that might suggest water leakage or weak spots in the insulation.With any resale home, there are bound to be a few issues that come up on the inspection report, like reasonable wear and tear from the previous owner. At the end of the day, it’s up to your discretion to renew the terms of the transaction and move forward to the closing table after receiving the report.If you’re looking to purchase a home in the near future, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’ll be happy to walk you through the process of a home inspection and set clear expectations about what kinds of repairs the home you purchase will need down the road. Hope to hear from you soon!",

Check your HVAC and have it serviced. Replace your filter, too! If you have an older thermostat, it might be time to consider switching to a programmable thermostat to save you a few bucks.2. Inspect your windows and doors. If there are cracks or air leaks, recaulk before winter to save even further on those heating costs.3. Clean out your gutters. Gutters that are clogged lead to water build-up and ice damming. This is definitely something you don’t want in the middle of winter.“Clogged gutters can lead to ice damming and leaks.”4. Reverse your ceiling fans. By reversing your fans, it will push the warm air from your furnace down to keep your living spaces warmer. 5. Turn off your exterior water taps. I’ve learned this the hard way. Hearing something burst in the wall during a cold night could lead to an explosion like it did for me.If you have any questions for me or if you’re thinking about buying or selling a home anytime soon, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "When you first get your mortgage, the majority of your payment goes toward your interest. However, there are ways to pay down the principal of your loan more quickly, and today we’ll cover three of the most effective methods:“If the rate you locked in originally is significantly higher than rates are right now, it may make sense to refinance your mortgage.”1. Round up your mortgage payments. If you had a $543 bi-weekly payment, for example, upping your payment to $600 would add an extra $14,000 toward your mortgage over time. This would shave years off of the life of your loan. 2. Put any extra money you come into toward your loan. If you get a tax break, for example, adding those funds to your loan could reduce your term by a year or more.3. Refinance when interest rates are low. Currently, interest rates are at historic lows. And with lower rates come lower monthly payments. Therefore, if the rate you locked in originally is significantly higher than rates are right now, it may make sense to refinance your mortgage. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "title": "What You Should Ask Before Hiring a Realtor",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Year to date, 9,716 homes have been listed in our market, but only 6,116 of those listings actually sold. This means 33% of all homes in our local market have failed to sell. Why has this happened? My guess is that, in many instances, those homes failed to sell because they were being represented by the wrong agent. This just goes to show how important your choice of Realtor really is when the time comes for you to sell, and the key to choosing the right agent is to ask the right questions before you hire them. Here are a few questions you should pose to any agent you’re thinking of working with: 1. “How many months of inventory are available in my area compared to the overall region?” Questions like this will not only help you to understand market conditions, but will also help you gauge how knowledgeable an agent is. In addition to explaining local inventory by area, the agent should also be able to break down inventory levels by price point.“A truly outstanding agent will have some unique qualities that set them apart from the common Realtor.”2. “What kind of marketing strategy will you use for my home?” The way your agent presents your property to the market could make or break your success. If they’re planning to solely rely on antiquated methods like newspaper ads, for example, you may want to work with someone else. It isn’t that newspaper advertising is bad; it’s just that the right agent should use multiple channels, including modern ones like social media, to maximize your home’s exposure.3. “What training events have you attended to continue your education as an agent?” In real estate, continued education is key. Simply having a real estate license isn’t enough. The right agent for you and your home sale is one who stays current with the latest best practices.4. “How much time will you spend prospecting?” Putting your home on the multiple listing service and hoping buyers take notice isn’t enough. The agent you hire should be one who is proactive in seeking out interested buyers for your property. 5. “What makes you stand out from other agents?” It goes without saying that a truly outstanding agent will have some unique qualities that set them apart from the common Realtor, and knowing what these qualities are, specifically, could guide you to making the right decision for your home sale. In addition to the questions we’ve listed today, we’ve got many more listed in our exclusive seller’s magazine. So if you have any other questions, would like a copy of our seller’s magazine, or are curious how my team and I can help you meet (and exceed) your real estate goals, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "If you’re gearing up to list your home soon, there are a few tips to keep in mind if you want to sell quickly and for top dollar. First, declutter the home. This means clearing off your countertops and making sure you have clean surfaces throughout the home. If buyers see clutter lying around, it will distract them from making an emotional connection to your home. Along with decluttering, you need to depersonalize the home. Remember, you want buyers to visualize themselves living in your home—not seeing who lives there now. Take down any family photos and try replacing them with some artwork or more generic photos. “Along with decluttering, you need to depersonalize the home.”Next, have a contractor or handyman visit your home and give it a good once-over. You never know—there may be spots that need to be repainted or trim that needs repair. Buyers notice little items like these, and taking care of them will help your home stand out among the competition. Also, consider getting a pre-inspection for your home. I’ve had several clients get higher offers with fewer conditions specifically because buyers knew their home had a pre-inspection. The home inspector will make sure your home’s not hiding any potential deal-killers that will cause the deal to fall apart after the buyer has already gone under contract. A pre-inspection also gives you the chance to fix any issues beforehand, which saves you money in the long run because you won’t have to worry about taking money off the sale price if the buyer discovers any issues. After that, it’s time to hire a professional stager to stage the home. We include a staging consultation in our services, and stagers will be able to advise you on furniture placement, wall decor, paint colors, decluttering and depersonalization, etc. They’ll have your home in the best shape possible when the time comes to take listing photos and videos. If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "We’re nearing the end of summer, so it’s time to take a quick look at how our 2019 summer market is doing as we wrap things up. This year, we’ve seen a high level of demand for homes priced at $600,000 or less—a sign that we’re still feeling the effects of the “stress test” we faced in 2018. Right now, we have about two to three months’ worth of inventory below the $500,000 range, and we see that number rise to between five and six months of inventory in the $500,000-to-$700,000 range. And with homes priced higher than $700,000, inventory shoots up to about eight months’ worth.           Keep in mind that the Bank of Canada did just lower the qualifying rate to 5.19%, which helped to kickstart more activity among first-timers and in some of the lower price points. In a nutshell, lower-priced homes are still selling strong.   Why is this important information for both buyers and sellers? Starting with buyers, it’s important to understand what you can expect given current market conditions. For instance, if you’re a first-time buyer and you’re entering the market for a $400,000 to $500,000 home, odds are that we’ll see some pretty stiff competition and multiple offers above asking price. “No matter your goals, my team and I are here to help.”The good news is that we’ll likely find homes that have spent a longer-than-normal amount of time on the market, which will allow us to negotiate for favorable terms. If we find ourselves in a multiple-offer situation, we can employ certain tactics to give ourselves an edge over the competition (e.g., a personal letter to the seller, preemptive inspections, etc.). On the seller side, if you’re pricing your home between $300,000 and $600,000, we’ll see a flurry of buyer activity. But because buyers are being a bit picky right now, it’s paramount that we still price at market value. On our team, we offer different strategies for pricing your home to bring as many buyers as possible to your door and potentially initiate a multiple-offer situation. No matter your goals, we’re here to help. If you have any questions about our current market or about buying, selling, or investing in real estate, feel free to contact me personally at Jerry@VanLeeuwenAdvisors.com or by calling us at 519-772-4328. We look forward to serving your needs!",
